## Completing Payment

If you manage to receive 'success' response from dischub that means your payment has been initiated but not yet completed. To complete the payment you have to attach the link below on the payment button which is on your website, you can name it 'Pay with DiscHub'. This button is the one going to be clicked by your customers so they can complete their payments on your dischub page

```bash
 https://dischub.co.zw/api/make/payment/to/{your_dischub_business_account_email}
```

Replace the {your_dischub_business_account_email} with your dischub business email as stated see example below

```bash
https://dischub.co.zw/api/make/payment/to/softwarez@gmail.com
```
